### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing following the existing pattern
- Use `npm test` to run all tests or `npx jest src/games/2048/Game2048.test.ts` for specific tests
- Follow existing patterns from Rock Paper Scissors and Tic Tac Toe implementations
- Ensure 100% test coverage for all public methods and edge cases
