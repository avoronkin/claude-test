# Rock Paper Scissors Browser Game - PRD

## Introduction/Overview

This feature implements a browser-based Rock Paper Scissors game that allows users to play against the computer. The game will provide an interactive web interface using the existing `RockPaperScissors.ts` library, giving users a simple and engaging way to play the classic game in their browser with immediate visual feedback.

## Goals

1. Create an interactive browser interface for the Rock Paper Scissors game
2. Integrate with the existing `RockPaperScissors.ts` class for game logic
3. Provide immediate visual feedback for game results
4. Ensure the game is accessible and easy to use for all skill levels
5. Maintain the stateless design philosophy of the underlying library

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to click buttons to select my move (rock, paper, or scissors) so that I can play against the computer
- As a user, I want to see the game result immediately after making my move so that I know if I won, lost, or drew
- As a user, I want to start a new game easily so that I can play multiple rounds
- As a user, I want to see both my move and the computer's move so that I understand how the result was determined
- As a user, I want the game to work in any modern web browser without additional software

## Functional Requirements

1. The game must provide three clickable buttons for move selection: "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors"
2. The game must display the user's selected move clearly after selection
3. The game must generate and display the computer's move automatically
4. The game must show the game result (win/lose/draw) with the explanation text from the library
5. The game must provide a "Play Again" button to start a new round
6. The game must use the existing `RockPaperScissors.playVsComputer()` method for game logic
7. The game must handle invalid states gracefully (though this should be rare with button interface)
8. The game must work in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
9. The game must be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices
10. The game must require no external dependencies beyond the existing TypeScript library

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Score tracking across multiple games
- User accounts or persistent data storage
- Multiplayer functionality (human vs human online)
- Complex animations or advanced visual effects
- Keyboard input support (buttons only)
- Game statistics or analytics
- Sound effects or audio feedback
- Different game modes or variations

## Design Considerations

- Use vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript to maintain simplicity and avoid framework dependencies
- Design should be clean and minimalist, focusing on functionality over aesthetics
- Button interface should be large enough for mobile touch interaction
- Visual hierarchy should make the current game state immediately clear
- Color coding can be used to indicate win (green), lose (red), and draw (yellow) states

## Technical Considerations

- Must integrate with the existing TypeScript library built in this project
- Should compile the TypeScript to JavaScript for browser consumption
- HTML file should be self-contained for easy deployment
- Consider bundling/build process to include the compiled library
- Ensure proper error handling even though button interface minimizes user errors
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility

## Success Metrics

- Game loads and functions correctly in target browsers
- Users can complete a full game cycle (select move, see result, play again) without errors
- Game responds within 100ms of user interaction
- Interface is intuitive enough that users don't need instructions
- Mobile users can interact with buttons easily (touch-friendly)

## Open Questions

1. Should the game state be visually distinct during move selection vs result display?
2. Do we need any loading states or can we assume instant computer move generation?
3. Should we include basic instructions on the page or assume users know Rock Paper Scissors rules?
4. What should be the default state when the page first loads?
