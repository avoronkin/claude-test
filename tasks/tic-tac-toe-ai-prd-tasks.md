## Relevant Files

- `src/games/tic-tac-toe/TicTacToe.ts` - Core game logic class that needs AI opponent functionality
- `src/games/tic-tac-toe/TicTacToe.test.ts` - Existing tests that need AI-specific test cases
- `src/games/tic-tac-toe/demo/main.ts` - Demo interface that needs UI updates for AI opponent
- `src/games/tic-tac-toe/demo/index.html` - HTML interface needing side selection and statistics UI
- `src/games/tic-tac-toe/demo/style.css` - Styling for AI move highlighting and new UI elements

### Notes

- Unit tests should be added to the existing `TicTacToe.test.ts` file for AI functionality
- Use `npm test` to run all tests, or `npx jest src/games/tic-tac-toe/TicTacToe.test.ts` for specific tests
- Follow existing immutable state pattern - AI moves return new game instances
- Maintain zero external dependencies requirement
- AI logic should integrate into existing TicTacToe class structure

## Tasks
