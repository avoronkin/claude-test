# 2048 Game - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview

Implement a classic 2048 puzzle game as part of the TypeScript games library. The 2048 game involves sliding numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. This implementation will follow the established library patterns with class-based architecture, immutable state management, and zero dependencies.

## Goals

1. Provide a fully functional 2048 game implementation following library conventions
2. Implement classic 2048 game mechanics with standard rules
3. Support keyboard controls (arrow keys) for tile movement
4. Include move history and undo functionality for enhanced gameplay
5. Track basic game metrics (score, moves count, time played)
6. Maintain <1ms performance for all game operations
7. Achieve 100% test coverage with comprehensive edge case handling

## User Stories

1. **As a player**, I want to start a new 2048 game so that I can begin playing immediately
2. **As a player**, I want to move tiles using arrow keys so that I can combine matching numbers
3. **As a player**, I want to see my current score so that I can track my progress
4. **As a player**, I want to undo my last move so that I can correct mistakes
5. **As a player**, I want to see the number of moves I've made so that I can optimize my strategy
6. **As a player**, I want to know when I've won (reached 2048) so that I can celebrate my achievement
7. **As a player**, I want to know when the game is over so that I can start a new game
8. **As a developer**, I want to integrate the 2048 game into my application using the same API pattern as other games

## Functional Requirements

1. **Game Initialization**: The system must create a new 4x4 grid with two random tiles (2 or 4) placed randomly
2. **Tile Movement**: The system must allow moving tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right) using arrow keys
3. **Tile Merging**: The system must combine two tiles with the same number when they collide during movement
4. **Score Calculation**: The system must calculate score as the sum of all merged tile values
5. **Move Counting**: The system must track the total number of valid moves made
6. **Time Tracking**: The system must track elapsed game time from start to finish
7. **Win Detection**: The system must detect when a tile reaches 2048 and mark the game as won
8. **Game Over Detection**: The system must detect when no valid moves are available and mark the game as over
9. **Move History**: The system must maintain a history of game states to enable undo functionality
10. **Undo Functionality**: The system must allow reverting to the previous game state
11. **Random Tile Generation**: The system must add a new random tile (2 or 4) after each valid move
12. **State Immutability**: The system must return new game instances for each move (no mutation)
13. **Input Validation**: The system must validate moves and reject invalid directions
14. **Error Handling**: The system must provide clear error messages for invalid operations

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Different grid sizes (5x5, 6x6, etc.)
- Touch/swipe gesture support
- Animations or visual transitions
- Persistent high scores or leaderboards
- Network multiplayer functionality
- Custom tile themes or visual customization
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Sound effects or audio feedback

## Design Considerations

- Follow the established class-based API pattern (`new Game2048()`)
- Maintain consistency with existing games' TypeScript interfaces
- Use minimal, clean styling for the demo similar to Rock Paper Scissors
- Grid should display clearly with numbered tiles and empty spaces
- Game state should be easily serializable for potential future save/load features

## Technical Considerations

- Implement using TypeScript with strict type checking
- Follow the existing project structure in `src/games/2048/`
- Use zero external dependencies
- Integrate with existing build system and demo infrastructure
- Ensure compatibility with both CommonJS and ES modules
- Implement comprehensive error classes for different game scenarios
- Optimize grid operations for <1ms performance requirement

## Success Metrics

- All game operations complete within <1ms performance requirement
- 100% test coverage achieved with comprehensive test suite
- Zero TypeScript errors or warnings
- Game follows all established library conventions and patterns
- Demo successfully builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
- All functional requirements verified through automated testing

## Open Questions

1. Should the undo functionality have a limit (e.g., last 10 moves only)?
2. What should be the probability distribution for new tiles (90% chance of 2, 10% chance of 4)?
3. Should we implement any specific animations timing for the demo, or keep it purely functional?
4. How should we handle rapid successive key presses to prevent input queue issues?
