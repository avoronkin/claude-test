# Product Requirements Document: Rock-Paper-Scissors Library

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for a TypeScript library that implements rock-paper-scissors game logic. The library will provide a reusable, class-based API for developers to integrate rock-paper-scissors functionality into web applications, mobile apps, educational projects, and games. The library focuses on core game mechanics with stateless operation, comprehensive error handling, and detailed game result explanations.

## Goals

1. Provide a simple, intuitive API for rock-paper-scissors game logic
2. Ensure type safety through comprehensive TypeScript definitions
3. Implement stateless operation for predictable, independent game calls
4. Support both single-player (vs computer) and two-player modes
5. Deliver comprehensive error handling for invalid moves
6. Create a lightweight, dependency-free library
7. Provide detailed game results with explanatory text

## User Stories

- **As a web developer**, I want to integrate rock-paper-scissors into my application so that users can play the game without me implementing the logic from scratch
- **As an educational app developer**, I want a reliable game engine so that students can learn probability and game theory concepts
- **As a mobile app developer**, I want both single-player and multiplayer modes so that users can play against the computer or friends
- **As a developer**, I want clear error messages so that I can handle invalid moves gracefully in my application
- **As a TypeScript developer**, I want full type safety so that I catch errors at compile time
- **As a game developer**, I want detailed result explanations so that players understand why they won or lost

## Functional Requirements

1. The library must provide a `RockPaperScissors` class that can be instantiated to create game instances
2. The system must support classic rock-paper-scissors rules with exactly 3 moves: Rock, Paper, Scissors
3. The system must provide a method for single-player games where one player competes against computer-generated moves
4. The system must provide a method for two-player games where both moves are provided by users
5. The system must validate moves and throw descriptive errors for invalid move inputs
6. The system must determine game outcomes according to standard rules:
   - Rock crushes Scissors
   - Scissors cuts Paper  
   - Paper covers Rock
   - Identical moves result in a tie
7. The system must return detailed game results including:
   - Winner identification (Player 1, Player 2, Computer, or Tie)
   - Move explanations ("Rock crushes Scissors")
   - Both player moves
8. The system must operate statelessly - each game call is independent with no persistent state
9. The system must generate random computer moves for single-player mode
10. The system must accept moves as both string literals ("rock", "paper", "scissors") and enum values
11. The system must provide case-insensitive move input handling
12. The system must include comprehensive TSDoc documentation for all public methods

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Advanced game variants (Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock, etc.)
- Best-of-X series or tournament functionality
- Move history tracking or game statistics
- Persistent state or game sessions
- AI strategy implementation (computer moves are random)
- Multiplayer networking functionality
- UI components or rendering logic
- Animation or visual effects
- Game persistence or serialization
- User authentication or player profiles

## Design Considerations

### API Design
- Class-based architecture with `new RockPaperScissors()` instantiation
- Stateless operation - no instance state persisted between game calls
- Clear method naming following TypeScript conventions
- Comprehensive type definitions for all public interfaces
- Support for both enum and string-based move inputs

### Game Modes
- `playVsComputer(playerMove)` - Single player against random computer move
- `playTwoPlayer(player1Move, player2Move)` - Two human players
- Consistent result format across both modes

### Error Handling
- Descriptive error messages for invalid move types
- Custom error classes for different error categories
- Input validation with helpful suggestions for correct format

### Result Format
- Consistent result object structure
- Explanatory text for educational value
- Clear winner identification

## Technical Considerations

- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking enabled
- **Dependencies**: Zero external dependencies for maximum compatibility
- **Build Target**: ES2017+ for modern JavaScript feature support
- **Module Format**: Support both CommonJS and ES modules
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit test coverage required
- **Documentation**: JSDoc/TSDoc comments for all public methods and properties
- **Random Generation**: Use built-in Math.random() for computer moves
- **Input Validation**: Accept multiple input formats with normalization

## Success Metrics

1. **Developer Experience**: Simple integration requiring < 5 lines of code for basic usage
2. **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with no `any` types in public API
3. **Reliability**: 100% test coverage for all game logic scenarios
4. **Performance**: Game operations complete in < 1ms
5. **Size**: Compiled library < 3KB minified
6. **Compatibility**: Works in Node.js and all modern browsers
7. **Educational Value**: Clear, explanatory result messages for learning purposes

## Open Questions

1. Should the library include additional move validation beyond the basic three moves?
2. What specific random number generation approach should be used for computer moves?
3. Should move inputs support abbreviations (r/p/s) in addition to full words?
4. What level of JSDoc documentation detail is expected for IntelliSense support?
5. Should the library provide move constants/enums for consumers to import?
6. Should computer move generation be seeded for testing reproducibility?
7. What error message format provides the best developer experience?
