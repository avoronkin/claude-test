# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Library - Task List

## Relevant Files

- `src/games/tic-tac-toe/TicTacToe.ts` - Main game logic class implementing the Tic-Tac-Toe game with immutable state management
- `src/games/tic-tac-toe/TicTacToe.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests for the TicTacToe class
- `src/games/tic-tac-toe/demo/index.html` - Browser demo HTML interface with 3x3 grid
- `src/games/tic-tac-toe/demo/main.ts` - Demo TypeScript logic for user interaction and game display
- `src/games/tic-tac-toe/demo/style.css` - Styling for the demo interface
- `src/games/tic-tac-toe/demo/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration for the demo
- `src/index.ts` - Main library exports file (needs to be updated to include TicTacToe)
- `package.json` - Package configuration (needs npm scripts for tic-tac-toe demo)
- `vite.tic-tac-toe.config.ts` - Vite configuration for building the tic-tac-toe demo
- `docs/index.html` - Main navigation page (needs to be updated with tic-tac-toe link)

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `TicTacToe.ts` and `TicTacToe.test.ts` in the same directory)
- Use `npm test` to run all tests or `npm test TicTacToe` to run specific tests
- Follow existing patterns from Rock Paper Scissors implementation for consistency
- All code must pass TypeScript strict type checking and linting
