# Tic-Tac-Toe Library Implementation Tasks

Based on: `prd-tic-tac-toe-library.md`

## Task List

### T001: Project Setup and Configuration
- [x] Initialize TypeScript project with tsconfig.json (strict mode enabled)
- [x] Set up package.json with build scripts and module configuration
- [x] Configure build tools for CommonJS and ES module output
- [x] Set up testing framework (Jest or similar)
- [x] Create basic project structure (src/, dist/, tests/)

### T002: Core Type Definitions
- [x] Define Player type ('X' | 'O')
- [x] Define GameStatus type ('in-progress' | 'won' | 'draw')
- [x] Define Board type (3x3 grid representation)
- [x] Define GameState interface
- [x] Define public API interfaces
- [x] Create custom error classes for different error types

### T003: Game State Management
- [x] Implement immutable board representation
- [x] Create methods for board state queries
- [x] Implement current player tracking
- [x] Add game status tracking
- [x] Implement cell state querying functionality

### T004: Core Game Logic
- [x] Implement move validation logic
  - [x] Check if cell is empty
  - [x] Check if coordinates are in bounds (0-2)
  - [x] Check if game has ended
- [x] Implement move execution with immutable state return
- [x] Add player turn alternation logic

### T005: Win Detection System
- [x] Implement horizontal win detection
- [x] Implement vertical win detection  
- [x] Implement diagonal win detection (both directions)
- [x] Create comprehensive win condition checker
- [x] Add winning player identification

### T006: Draw Detection
- [x] Implement board full detection
- [x] Add draw condition logic (board full + no winner)
- [x] Update game status appropriately

### T007: Error Handling Implementation
- [x] Create descriptive error messages for invalid moves
- [x] Implement error throwing for occupied cells
- [x] Add error handling for out-of-bounds moves
- [x] Create errors for moves after game end
- [x] Implement custom error classes with proper inheritance

### T008: TicTacToe Class Implementation
- [x] Create main TicTacToe class with constructor
- [x] Implement makeMove method returning new instance
- [x] Add getter methods for board state access
- [x] Implement getCurrentPlayer method
- [x] Add getGameStatus method
- [x] Create getCellState method
- [x] Add getWinner method (when applicable)

### T009: Comprehensive Testing
- [x] Write unit tests for move validation
- [x] Test all win condition scenarios
- [x] Test draw condition detection
- [x] Test error handling for all invalid move types
- [x] Test immutable state behavior
- [x] Test player alternation logic
- [x] Add edge case testing
- [x] Verify 100% code coverage

### T010: Documentation and Build ✅
- [x] Add JSDoc comments to all public methods and properties
- [x] Create README with usage examples
- [x] Generate TypeScript declaration files
- [x] Build and test CommonJS output
- [x] Build and test ES module output
- [x] Verify library size requirements (<5KB minified)

### T011: Final Validation ✅
- [x] Run full test suite and verify 100% pass rate
- [x] Verify TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [x] Test library integration in sample projects
- [x] Validate performance requirements (<1ms operations)
- [x] Check compatibility with Node.js and browsers
