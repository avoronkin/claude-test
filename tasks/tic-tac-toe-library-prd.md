# Product Requirements Document: Tic-Tac-Toe Library

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for a TypeScript library that implements tic-tac-toe game logic. The library will provide a reusable, class-based API for developers to integrate tic-tac-toe functionality into web applications, mobile apps, and games. The library focuses on core game mechanics with clean, immutable state management and comprehensive error handling.

## Goals

1. Provide a simple, intuitive API for tic-tac-toe game logic
2. Ensure type safety through comprehensive TypeScript definitions
3. Implement immutable state management for predictable behavior
4. Support all standard tic-tac-toe rules and win conditions
5. Deliver comprehensive error handling for invalid game actions
6. Create a lightweight, dependency-free library

## User Stories

- **As a web developer**, I want to integrate tic-tac-toe into my application so that users can play the game without me implementing the logic from scratch
- **As a mobile app developer**, I want a reliable game engine so that I can focus on UI/UX rather than game rules
- **As a game developer**, I want immutable state management so that I can easily implement undo functionality or time-travel debugging
- **As a developer**, I want clear error messages so that I can handle invalid moves gracefully in my application
- **As a TypeScript developer**, I want full type safety so that I catch errors at compile time

## Functional Requirements

1. The library must provide a `TicTacToe` class that can be instantiated to create a new game
2. The system must track the current player (X or O) and automatically alternate turns
3. The system must validate moves and throw descriptive errors for invalid attempts (occupied cells, game already ended, out-of-bounds moves)
4. The system must detect win conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal lines of 3)
5. The system must detect draw conditions (board full with no winner)
6. The system must provide methods to make moves by specifying row and column coordinates (0-2)
7. The system must return immutable game state objects, creating new instances rather than modifying existing ones
8. The system must provide read-only access to current board state, current player, and game status
9. The system must support querying individual cell states
10. The system must provide game status information (in-progress, won, draw)
11. The system must identify the winning player when a game is won
12. The system must prevent moves after the game has ended

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- AI opponent implementation
- Multiplayer networking functionality
- Configurable board sizes (only 3x3 standard grid)
- Custom win conditions beyond standard tic-tac-toe rules
- Game persistence or serialization
- Undo/redo functionality
- Move history tracking
- UI components or rendering logic
- Game timer functionality

## Design Considerations

### API Design
- Class-based architecture with `new TicTacToe()` instantiation
- Immutable state pattern - each move returns a new game instance
- Clear method naming following TypeScript conventions
- Comprehensive type definitions for all public interfaces

### Error Handling
- Descriptive error messages for different invalid move types
- Custom error classes for different error categories
- Fail-fast approach with immediate error throwing

## Technical Considerations

- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking enabled
- **Dependencies**: Zero external dependencies for maximum compatibility
- **Build Target**: ES2017+ for modern JavaScript feature support
- **Module Format**: Support both CommonJS and ES modules
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit test coverage required
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments for all public methods and properties

## Success Metrics

1. **Developer Experience**: Simple integration requiring < 10 lines of code for basic usage
2. **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with no `any` types in public API
3. **Reliability**: 100% test coverage for all game logic scenarios
4. **Performance**: Game state operations complete in < 1ms
5. **Size**: Compiled library < 5KB minified
6. **Compatibility**: Works in Node.js and all modern browsers

## Open Questions

1. Should the library include TypeScript declaration files bundled, or rely on source TS files?
2. What specific build tools/bundlers should be supported for optimal integration?
3. Should coordinate system be 0-based or 1-based for row/column indices?
4. What level of JSDoc documentation detail is expected for IntelliSense support?
