# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Library - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for implementing a Tic-Tac-Toe game as part of the TypeScript games library. The feature will expand the library's capabilities by adding a turn-based strategy game that demonstrates state management with a game board. The goal is to provide a reusable, class-based Tic-Tac-Toe implementation following the same patterns established by the Rock Paper Scissors game.

## Goals

1. Implement a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game library following the established class-based architecture
2. Create a browser demo showcasing the game functionality with simple HTML interface
3. Maintain consistency with existing library patterns (immutable state, zero dependencies, comprehensive error handling)
4. Ensure 100% test coverage and TypeScript type safety
5. Provide clean API for integration into other projects

## User Stories

**As a developer integrating the library, I want to:**
- Create a new Tic-Tac-Toe game instance with `new TicTacToe()`
- Make moves by specifying row and column coordinates
- Check the current game state (ongoing, won, draw)
- Get the current player turn (X or O)
- Receive a new game instance after each move (immutable state)

**As an end user of the demo, I want to:**
- Click on empty cells in a 3x3 grid to make moves
- See visual feedback showing X and O marks
- Know whose turn it is
- Be notified when the game ends (win/draw)
- Start a new game easily

## Functional Requirements

1. The `TicTacToe` class must be instantiable with `new TicTacToe()`
2. The system must provide a `makeMove(row: number, col: number)` method that returns a new game instance
3. The system must track the current player (X always goes first)
4. The system must validate moves to ensure cells are empty and coordinates are valid (0-2 range)
5. The system must detect win conditions (3 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
6. The system must detect draw conditions (board full with no winner)
7. The system must prevent moves after game completion
8. The system must provide getters for: current player, game status, board state, winner
9. The system must throw descriptive errors for invalid moves
10. The demo must display a 3x3 clickable grid
11. The demo must show current player and game result
12. The demo must include a "New Game" button

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Undo/redo functionality
- Save/load game state
- AI opponent
- Multiplayer networking
- Advanced UI animations or effects
- Game history tracking
- Score keeping across multiple games

## Design Considerations

- Follow the same HTML/CSS structure as Rock Paper Scissors demo
- Use simple table or grid layout for the 3x3 board
- Maintain consistent styling with existing demos
- Keep UI minimal and functional

## Technical Considerations

- Must integrate with existing build system and npm scripts
- Should follow the same file structure: `src/games/tic-tac-toe/TicTacToe.ts`
- Must include comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage
- Should use custom error classes for different failure scenarios
- Must maintain zero external dependencies
- Performance target: move validation and win detection under 1ms

## Success Metrics

- 100% test coverage achieved
- All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Demo successfully deploys to GitHub Pages
- Library maintains target bundle size (<5KB minified)
- No runtime errors in demo usage

## Open Questions

- None at this time - requirements are clear and aligned with existing library patterns
