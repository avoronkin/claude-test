# Product Requirements Document: Tic-Tac-Toe AI Opponent

## Introduction/Overview

This feature adds an AI opponent to the existing Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing users to play against a computer instead of requiring two human players. The AI will use an advanced minimax algorithm to provide an unbeatable opponent, enhancing the single-player gaming experience.

## Goals

1. Implement an unbeatable AI opponent using minimax algorithm
2. Allow players to choose between playing as X (crosses) or O (circles)
3. Provide visual feedback for AI moves with animation and highlighting
4. Display appropriate game status messages during AI turns
5. Track and display statistics for games played against the computer

## User Stories

- **As a single player**, I want to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer opponent so that I can enjoy the game without needing another person
- **As a competitive player**, I want to face an unbeatable AI so that I can challenge my strategic thinking
- **As a user**, I want to choose whether to play as X or O so that I can vary my gameplay experience
- **As a visual learner**, I want to see the AI's move clearly highlighted so that I can understand what move was made
- **As a progress tracker**, I want to see my win/loss/draw statistics against the computer so that I can monitor my improvement

## Functional Requirements

1. **Game Mode**: The game must always be player vs computer (no human vs human mode)
2. **Side Selection**: The system must allow the player to choose between X (crosses) or O (circles) before starting
3. **AI Intelligence**: The system must implement a minimax algorithm that makes the AI unbeatable
4. **Move Animation**: The system must show a brief delay/animation when the AI is making a move to simulate "thinking"
5. **Move Highlighting**: The system must visually highlight the AI's last move on the board
6. **Status Messages**: The system must display "Ход компьютера..." (Computer's turn...) during AI move processing
7. **Statistics Tracking**: The system must track and display win/loss/draw statistics specifically for games against the computer
8. **First Move Logic**: The system must randomly determine who goes first (player or AI) at the start of each new game
9. **Immediate Response**: After player move, AI must respond within reasonable time (100-500ms delay for UX)
10. **Game State Management**: The system must maintain all existing game state management patterns (immutable state, new instance per move)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Multiple difficulty levels (only unbeatable AI)
- Human vs human multiplayer mode
- Online multiplayer functionality
- AI personality or character traits
- Voice or sound effects
- Save/resume game functionality
- Tournament or championship modes

## Design Considerations

- **UI Integration**: Integrate seamlessly with existing Tic-Tac-Toe demo interface
- **Side Selection UI**: Add radio buttons or toggle for X/O selection before game start
- **Move Highlighting**: Use CSS animation or border styling to highlight AI's last move
- **Loading States**: Show subtle loading indicator or "thinking" animation during AI turn
- **Statistics Display**: Add statistics section showing games played, wins, losses, draws against AI

## Technical Considerations

- **Algorithm**: Implement minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal performance
- **Class Structure**: Extend existing TicTacToe class to include AI player functionality
- **State Management**: Maintain immutable state pattern - AI moves return new game instances
- **Performance**: AI move calculation must complete within 100ms for responsive UX
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for AI-related methods and properties
- **Testing**: 100% test coverage for AI logic, including edge cases and game scenarios

## Success Metrics

- **Unbeatable AI**: Player should never be able to win against the AI (only draw or lose)
- **Performance**: AI move calculation completes in <100ms
- **User Engagement**: Clear visual feedback makes AI moves easily identifiable
- **Code Quality**: Maintains existing code standards and test coverage requirements
- **Integration**: Seamlessly works within existing demo without breaking functionality

## Open Questions

1. Should there be a difficulty toggle for future expansion (easy/medium/hard)?
2. Should the AI have any intentional "personality" in move selection when multiple optimal moves exist?
3. Should statistics persist across browser sessions (localStorage)?
4. Should there be an option to replay the last game to analyze moves?

## Implementation Notes

- Follow existing project patterns in `src/games/rock-paper-scissors/` for reference
- AI logic should be a separate method within the TicTacToe class
- Maintain zero external dependencies requirement
- Update existing demo interface rather than creating new files
- Ensure all public methods have JSDoc documentation
